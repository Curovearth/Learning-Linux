## Creating and Editing Files

1. We do this with the help of a variety of command-line or GUI-based text editors.
2. gedit is a GUI-based editor that provides many features to simplify your work
3. GNU nano is a command line editor that provides similar functionality in a command line format

## Installing Software and Updates

### Deb and RPM packages

- deb and RPM formats are equivalent. so the contents of the file can be used on other types of Linux OSs.
- If a package is only available in one format you can use alien to convert it: 
    - RPM to deb: `alien <package-name>.rpm`    
    - deb to RPM: `alien -r <package-name>.deb`

### Updating deb-based Linux

- Command line: `apt`
    - `sudo apt update`: to find available packages for your distro
    - `sudo apt upgrade`: to install packages
    - `sudo apt upgrade <package-name>`: for installing specific package

### Updating RPM-based Linux

- GUI tool: **PackageKit**
    - notifies you when updates are available
    - lists available software updates

- Command Line tool: **yum**
    - yum: yellow-dog updater modified
    - `sudo yum update`
        - gives a summary of all the available packages
        - asks to confirm the download

### Installing new software

- Installing a deb package with apt:
    - `sudo apt install <package-name>`
- Installing an RPM package with yum:
    - `sudo yum install <package-name>`
